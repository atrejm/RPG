This is meant to be a development log for myself to gather my thoughts and summarize my 
learning sessions while using the Udemy RPG Core Combat Creator course.

Log 7/17/2022: 
    Having just finished the GMTK 2022 GameJam, I found myself very motivated to learn more about 
    how to create and maintain a more scalable and robust game. 

    This project is aimed at intermediate Unity students, requiring some previous knowledge of
    the Unity engine and C# scripting.

    I'll be building a RPG inspired by Diablo, Torchlight, etc. that includes Combat, Inventory 
    management, save state structures, stats and attributes, and more

    What I did:
        Used terrain tool to create a varying terrain, height map, painting textures, painting trees
        Used a NavMeshAgent component to traverse the terrain by setting NavMeshAgent.setDestination()

    What I learned:
        I learned about the terrain tool, which makes building an environment in unity quite easy. You
        can add a navigation mesh to the terrain which gives any NavMeshAgent areas where they can or
        cannot walk based on parameters set in the Navigation window which is AI -> Navigation. 

        You can also use the terrain paint tools to quickly paint prefabs onto the scene, which is neat.

    What I did:
        Made tweaks to the NavMesh to make the mesh fidelity make more sense with the scene I built. 
        Used Camera.ScreenPointToRay to make player go where the mouse clicks. 
        Made the camera follow the player by creating a child of the player that only follows its
        position, not rotation.

    What I learned:
        Nothing big. I've done more complex raycasting stuff before. The follow camera child trick is
        kind of neat, i probably would have over-complicated it through some script.

    What I did:
        Updated the character to go through a series of animations with a Animation Blend Tree. Attached
        it based on player movement speed. Also some tidying up of folders. Short day today woo.

    What I learned:
        Blend Tree animations is a new concept I haven't seen yet.

    What I did:
        Added more raycasting features to know when we are clicking on an enemy. Added namespaces to
        all of our features to control dependencies.

    What I learned:
        I learned what namespaces are and why to use them. They act as a filter to control dependencies 
        between classes, to avoid getting too spaghettified. Also learned about the 'continue' keyword, 
        which will tell the compiler to skip the rest of that chunk of code.

        Learned about short circuit operators.

        Learned about interfaces. An interface is something that an object can inherit from which will
        specify what methods are required. This allows you to pass objects of different classes as
        a parameter, ensuring that both objects have a method with the name listed in the interface.
                Mover.Cancel() and Fighter.Cancel()

    What I did: 
        - Added patrol points
        - Enemies approach and attack the player when in range
        - Nested prefabs to make enemies and players inherit from 'character'

    What I learned:
        Learned about using the Modulo(%) to loop a closed loop. IDK how no one has ever showed me this, but
        you can do '(i+1)%arraySize' to get the index looped around. i.e (array[arraySize + 1] == array[0]).

        Neat.
